So at first I wanted to make an hour long video of me talking while having PSO as my background footage but video editor didn't want to cooperate.

So instead I'll just write them down here in a short version instead.

#  The web side
* You might noticed how minimal/barebones the main site is and it is intentional. The reason why, is that if my website is not mobile friendly for Google, my site is most likely not to appear if anyone searches my site from their portable device (if they are searching on Google of course.)
* Because of that I had to find something to get out of Wordpress because the navigation buttons are too small and other things that I also do not like about Wordpress. So I found a quick solution called Grawlix and after wasting 30-40 hours I could not get it to work. I did get help from both the creators of the CMS and the host services. No luck. So I end up going back to the minimal/barebones Poor Man's Comic Publisher which is created by Triskaideka.
* While trying to get into Grawlix I also switch hosts in hopes of getting Grawlix to work. I ended up switching from A Small Orange to HostGator. Might as well have unlimited bandwidth (unmetered.)

#  The Grey universe
* I am trying to make more evil characters for the GreySky series. So far I have a couple in concept.
* I have V the punk leader, Des the rejected spy, Sis the sharpshooter/sniper, Zoe the goth magic-user.
* The ones that doesn't have a name yet is the cyborg who uses an assault rifle and an odd suitcase, talented young dark-skin boy is has a knack for fixing things.
* The names are subject to change by the way.
* I am very happy about how I manage to put together the new house that the characters are moving to. I may make a BTS (behind the scenes) of how the house is laid out.
* Character list is still within planning. I don't know if a wiki is needed yet.

#  Personal things/making art stuff
* Around March 2016 I started releasing webcomics weekly instead of rarely posting anything.
* I'll admit things are getting a bit difficult in terms of getting the webcomics out. I think there is only two times that I have past the actual day the new webcomic should be out but instead it ended up being several hours late. I apologize for that.
* I have intentionally avoid buying the new MonsterHunter game because the pervious MonsterHunter game I've played, I wasted more than 500+ hours. There is a lot I could of done with those collected amount of hours. It is also the reason why I haven't made any new webcomics for 1.5 years. That had changed when I started pushing out webcomics weekly on March 2016. I used to be part of a group that plays MonsterHunter and I know they would taunt me to the point where they would discourage me from drawing and just play with them instead. That is no longer a problem now.
* Games I still have interest, planning to play them, or already playing them:
- Any PSO games
- Pokemon Sun and Moon
- Pokemon romhacks
- Black Desert Online
*  Yet despite of all that I've uninstalled Steam. The reason is that not only, I want to "try" to stray away from games, but I want to stop myself from buying games only then I do not even play them. Save myself the money (and time.)

#  Last major news
* Have load of things I want to write on the blog, reviewing laptops,  reviewing books, tutorials, and more.
* I wanted to open up a Patreon once my 50th webcomic is out but I deiced that I do not want to because of two points. 1.) I have nothing written down for it. Not even a draft. 2.) I don't think I deserve it yet.

I want to thank everyone who read my webcomcics. Whenever late or not, thank you.
